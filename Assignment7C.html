            <h1>About the Game</h1>
            <p>The game was originally intended to be a casual party game. However the game mechanics allowed players to move around much faster than the game developers had intended and because of this, the competitive scene was born.</p>
            <p>Things like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EcPgWGiEhk">wavedashing</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNuYq7_nwzY">L-Canceling</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QF66L9UFvPo">short-hops</a> all allowed the player to move around much quicker. Some maneuvers require you to be "frame-perfect". On average a Melee player will press three to six buttons per second while moving around and attacking their opponent.</p>
            <p>Because of the massive skill ceiling, Super Smash Bros. Melee is widely considered the most competitive game in the series.</p>

            <h3> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIsTgPo71Kc">
                Here is a set between Mango and Leffen. </h3>  </a>
                <p>In this best of 5 game, Mango plays as Falco and Leffen plays on Fox. Watch how fast these players are moving and making decisions.</p>
            <h3> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4YKPIwnzyk">
                Here is some gameplay of Captain Falcon played by N0ne.</h3>  </a>
                <p>Captain Falcon is easily the most stylish character to play. His hard hitting knees and kicks are enough to make anyone appreciate the style a player can implement into their combos. (Video does have some explicit language)</p>
